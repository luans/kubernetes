# kubernetes

## What is this?

I'm using this repo to dump all the stuffs I learn, random scripts I write, and configuration examples so I don't have to Google them 100 times. It's a mix of automations, "how-to" guides, and playgrounds for testing new tools.

## The Layout

Here is how I organized this mess:

```text
.
├── 📂 automations/       # Scripts to make life easier
├── 📂 commands/          # Basic commands to make life easier
├── 📂 deployments/       # Basic YAMLs (Deployments, PVCs, etc.)
├── 📂 helm-charts/       # Charts I'm playing around with
├── 📂 networking/        # Ingress, Services, and network configurations
├── 📂 observability/     # Keeping an eye on things (Prometheus/Grafana)
├── 📂 security/          # Breaking and fixing permission things
├── 📂 terraform/         # Terraform configurations and examples
└── 📂 troubleshooting/   # Notes on stuff that crashed
```
